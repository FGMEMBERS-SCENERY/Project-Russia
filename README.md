Project-Russia
==============

Scenery of Russia for FlightGear Flight simulator.

Installation:
1. Open "Custom_materials" folder and merge data inside it with $FGDATA folder. It will overwrite 3 files in your $FGDATA folder.
2. For better aeronavigation, freshest data on airports, presented in this scenery pack it's better to merge data in folder aeronav/fgdata. In this step some data in $FGDATA will be overwritten, but with equal or more fresh data.

Running:
If you run FG via commandline, you need to do this thing:
 - Add path to scenery: --fg-scenery=/home/path-to-scenery/Project-Russia (my example with terrasync data: --fg-scenery=/home/soitanen/Project-Russia:/home/soitanen/Terrasync)
